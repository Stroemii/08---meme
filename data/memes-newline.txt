When I can't find any coffee and still have to work
When I have to think about Monday morning again on Friday evening
When I arrive at the office on Monday morning
When my colleague next door just barely gets by
When I find the solution to my problem on Stack Overflow
When I can't find a solution to my problem on Stack Overflow
When I finally find my mistake after several hours of searching
When my program runs without any errors for once
When I try to look like I have a plan for what I'm doing
When other programmers look at my code
When I look at my code from last week today
When I proudly tell my friends that I can program
When Jannis releases another new course
When I see another job listing for a junior position - that requires 30 years of experience
When I have automated my job - and my boss doesn't realize that I no longer need to work
When I finish another online course
When the solution I've been searching for - suddenly comes to me while I'm in the bathroom
When I have Wi-Fi on the train for just a minute
